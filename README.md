> Participants will learn basic concepts, theoretical foundations and relevant
> algorithms developed in the field of event-based (i.e., neuromorphic) vision.
> Upon completing the module, participants will have an overview of the field,
> spanning from the principle of operation of event-based sensors (e.g.,
> event-based cameras), their advantages and disadvantages, to the methods used
> to process their output for a target application. Participants will also be
> aware of the differences with standard (frame-based) computer vision, in terms
> of methods, performance criteria and applications.
